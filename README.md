My kids have many Minecraft servers linked back to /usr/local/bin/minecraft_server.jar. Unfortunately, each time Minecraft versions change, it breaks, requiring me to manually find the latest version of the server for Linux, download it, and move it in place. 

This automates that process for Minecraft servers on Linux.
